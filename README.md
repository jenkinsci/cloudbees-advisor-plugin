| Property                                                                                           | Default | Unit    | Description                                      |

## Troubleshooting

### Manual upload launch

The following can be run from the Script Console to manually trigger an upload:

```
import hudson.model.*
import hudson.triggers.*
import jenkins.util.Timer;


for(trigger in PeriodicWork.all()) {
  if(trigger.class.name == "com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.advisor.BundleUpload"){
    trigger.run()
    return
  }
}
```

### Idle timeout

Bundle uploads fail with:

```
SEVERE: Issue while uploading file to bundle upload service: java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Request reached idle time out of 120000 ms after 120483 ms
```

Try adjusting the idle timeout period.

See the [CloudBees Jenkins Advisor Upload Timeout](#CloudBees-Jenkins-Advisor-Upload-Timeout) section for how to do that.

### File is not a normal file.

Bundle uploads fail with:

```
The CloudBees Jenkins Advisor upload failed: ERROR: Issue while uploading file to bundle upload service: An error occurred while checking server status during bundle upload. 
Message: com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.advisor.client.AdvisorClient$InsightsUploadFileException: Exception trying to upload support bundle. Message: File is not a normal file.
```

Check the logs as the cause should be printed as  a `SEVERE` message along with the above message (`File is not a normal file.`) duplicated.
